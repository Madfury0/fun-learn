The game is a text-based RPG (Role-Playing Game) where the player navigates through different rooms, encounters enemies, and collects treasures.

This development was a simple console-based game in C++ that covers various aspects of the language, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file I/O, error handling, and user input/output.

New python script added with similar functionalities as the c++ one, but with something more :)
Added modular programming in python for the various aspects of the game.
